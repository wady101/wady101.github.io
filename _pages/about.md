Hey! I am a passionate Senior Software Engineer with a keen enthusiasm for crafting efficient and robust solutions in C and C++. At times dabble in rust and python.

My research and programming interests include developing models, hobby-compilers, FPGA-tooling and embedded-drivers (in no particular order ðŸ˜‰).

Feel free to get in touch if you share similar interests and would like to collaborate ðŸ˜Š.
