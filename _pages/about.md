Hello! I am someone who enjoys tackling complex problems through efficient and robust solutions in C and C++, with occasional forays into Rust and Python.

My research and programming interests include developing models, hobby-compilers, FPGA-tooling and embedded-drivers (in no particular order ðŸ˜‰).

Feel free to get in touch if you share similar interests and would like to collaborate ðŸ˜Š.
